# DAY 1
In this assignment, I have submitted two primary files: app.py, requrements.txt and a Dockerfile.

The app.py file contains a basic Flask web application that returns a simple message — "Hello from Flask" — when accessed. The application runs successfully on port 5000.

The second file, Dockerfile, is used to create a Docker image of the Flask application. The image was successfully built and pushed to Docker Hub.

You can access the image on Docker Hub using the following link:
